Description: This package provides wrappers around the Python implementation of the Rosetta pedotransfer function model. Rosetta predicts parameters for the van Genuchten unsaturated soil hydraulic properties model, using as input basic soil characterization data: sand, silt, and clay, bulk density and water content. The codebase is now maintained by Dr. Todd Skaggs and other U.S. Department of Agriculture employees. This R package is intended to provide for use cases that involve many thousands of calls to the pedotransfer function. Less demanding use cases are encouraged to use the web interface or API endpoint. There are additional wrappers of the API endpoints provided by the soilDB R package `ROSETTA()` method.
